TEXT128 "Page not found. Please contact mod author."
TEXT129 "In addition to laying your fortress under the mountain, you can also construct outdoor buildings. It is possible for buildings to have multiple floors, and there is no limit on how many staircases you can build between the so-called Z-levels."
TEXT130 "1. To start, designate \"building interior\" somewhere outdoors."
TEXT131 "Once built, this area is considered roofed and you can place all usual constructions and furniture in it. You may also surround it with walls, but it's not required."
TEXT132 "2. Now build \"Up stairs\" somewhere inside your new building, and you will gain access to a new Z-level above the current one. There are several ways to scroll your map to it. Use Ctrl + mouse wheel, or click on the stairs themselves, or use the Z-level menu under the minimap. You can also use the , and . keys or control a minion and walk up manually."
TEXT133 "Note that you can also use the Z-level menu and the Ctrl + mouse wheel shortcut in control mode to have your minion auto-travel between Z-levels."
TEXT134 "3. Place building interior on your new building floor to build something there. Also notice that the level's topography spans multiple Z-levels, and you can gain access to new resources and other goodies when exploring \"up\"."
TEXT135 "Riding steeds can enhance your minions' fighting abilities, let them gain speed or navigate over inaccessible terrain."
TEXT136 "1. Get hold of some ridable creatures, such as horses, wolves or a dragon. You can identify steeds by their \"steed\" status."
TEXT137 "2. You'll need a minion that can ride steeds. There is a high chance that your Keeper can depending on their class."
TEXT138 "3. Assign the steed to your rider. You can do that in the equipment list in the minion's menu. Chances are a steed has already been assigned automatically."
TEXT139 "Keep in mind that a rider can only ride steeds of compatible size. Large creatures can ride large and huge steeds, while medium and small creatures can only ride steeds of exactly their size. For example most humans will ride horses and dragons, goblins will ride wolves, and imps will ride bats and rabbits."
TEXT140 "4. The rider will now always mount its steed when leaving your base. In the turn-based mode you can mount your steed manually by pressing 'm' or by right clicking on your steed and choosing \"mount\"."
TEXT141 "Depending on your game's settings, most of your enemies and allies will likely be located away from your home site. "
TEXT142 "TBF"
TEXT143 "The amount of damage a creature takes in combat is dependent on its defense value, the value of the attack and certain modifiers. Different attack types use different attribute values as their base: most melee combat uses the damage attribute, ranged attacks use ranged damage, and magical attacks use spell damage."
TEXT144 "Once we know the attack value, we can apply special attack bonuses, for example some creatures have a higher attack when drunk or against certain enemies, such as undead. These bonuses are always listed in the creature's description."
TEXT145 "The victim uses the defense attribute as its base defense value, and we similarly apply any special defense bonuses the creature has. After that we multiply or divide the value by 1.3 if the creature is resistant or vulnerable to the attack type. For example with magic resistance, your defense is 30% higher against magical attacks."
TEXT146 "We also calculate a flanking multiplier based on by how many enemies a creature is surrounded by. For each enemy the final defense value is divided by 1.07. This is countered by the parry attribute, which is increased by shields."
TEXT147 "Having the final attack and defense values, we divide them by each other, and apply a damage curve that finally tells us how much health the victim loses."
TEXT148 "As you can see, you'll lose all your health if the attack is 2.2 stronger than your defense, 12% if they're equal, and the attack will be harmless if it's 0.6 of the defense value or lower."
TEXT149 "What happens from now on depends a lot on the victim. Creatures made of flesh, fire or spirit have a normal health counter from which the health loss will be subtracted. Other creatures, such as undead, golems and automatons, have a chance of losing a limb or falling apart based on the magnitude of the loss, but the game doesn't directly track health for them. "
TEXT150 "Setting up guard zones allows you to place your minions in chosen spots to watch for potential invaders."
TEXT151 "1. Choose one of the three guard area colors, and place it on the map. You should place just one tile for every minion you expect to stand on guard."
TEXT152 "2. Choose the type of minions that will attend this guard area color. It's easiest to select a whole group, such as all goblin warriors or all melee dwarves. Go to one of the minions' menu, select their activity, and enable the chosen guard zone activity for the whole group."
TEXT153 "Now this group's activities include guarding. It works best if the group is much bigger than the number of placed guard posts, as this will allow them to rotate, and peform other activities as well."
TEXT154 "Want to supplement your workforce or convert enemies to fight on your side? You can do that by capturing enemy creatures."
TEXT155 "1. Right click on an enemy and toggle the capture order. You'll notice that the color of its health bar changes to white."
TEXT156 "2. Fight the enemy until it is stunned. Keep in mind that some creatures are resistant to capturing, and are much harder to capture than to simply kill."
TEXT157 "3. Back in real-time mode, you'll find the stunned creature in your immigration list. Click on it to enslave it."
TEXT158 "4. Your prisoner now supplies your worker force. To completely convert it to your side, order its torture by dragging its icon to a torture table. The prisoner has a 50% chance to convert, otherwise it dies."
CAMPAIGN_HELP_TEXT "Welcome to the campaign mode! The world, which you see below, is made up of smaller maps. You will build your base on one of them. There are hostile and friendly tribes around you. You have to conquer all villains marked as \"main\" to win the game. You can travel to other sites by creating a team and using the travel command.

Try locking and unlocking your new door."
TUTORIAL_BUILD_LIBRARY "The first room that you need to build is a library. This is where the Keeper and other minions will learn spells, and train their spell damage attribute.
